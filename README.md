# Challenges

We don't want to you to spend more than a few hours on this - rather less than 3 if you have prior knowledge in the respective technologies.

The goal is to have some mostly-working code that was recently developed by yourself, which is still small enough so we can quickly understand it ourselves.
We then would like to talk about the concrete code in the next interview round so that we can get an impression of your thought process - how much focus is there on readability and terseness, what algorithms were used, what design patterns were applied, what kind of features you thought of, what kind of bugs you introduced.
If you hit a roadblock at some point during the coding, that's not an issue, but rather an interesting point for discussion.
What was your approach to solve or work around the problem?

If you have further questions about the process and upcoming interview, feel free to email your contact person in the company.
